   template](./docs/pull_request_template.md).

   project's [README](./README.md) file. The versioning scheme we use is

   variables, build flags, feature toggles, exposed port number, base container
   images, important file locations, bootstrapping process changes, cli
   parameters, etc; update the [README](./README.md) file accordingly.
1. Label your pull request following the project standards.
1. You may merge the pull request in once you have the sign-off of two other
   developers; or ask the second reviewer to merge it for you if you don't have
   the required permissions.

   e.g. add/remove labels, close the original issue, etc.
